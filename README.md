## Foundry template

This is my take for a Foundry template and instructions to get started and help you to have an easy start for every project.

## Using this template

Starting a new project:

´´´
forge init --template https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-template my_project_name
cd my_project_name
´´´

## Usage

Install dependencies:

´´´
forge install
´´´

Build the project:

´´´
forge build
´´´

Run the tests:

´´´
forge test
´´´
