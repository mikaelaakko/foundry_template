## Foundry template

This is my take for a Foundry template and instructions to get started and help you to have an easy start for every project.

## Using this template

Starting a new project:

```
forge init --template https://github.com/mikaelaakko/foundry_template my_project_name
cd my_project_name
```

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```
forge install
```

Build the project:

```
forge build
```

Run the tests:

```
forge test
```

## Template libaries

I always like to have all the libraries with me when I start a project so I'll have a bunch of libraries preinstalled in the template and then remove the unneccessary ones later. Some awesome libraries that this template contains:

**1. openzeppelin**

**2. solmate**

**3. solidstate-solidity**

**4. openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable**

**5. ERC721A**

**6. ERC721A-Upgradeable**

**7. murky**

**8. prb-test**

**9. ds-test**

**10. clones-with-immutable args**
