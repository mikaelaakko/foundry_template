## Foundry template

This is my take for a Foundry template and instructions to get started and help you to have an easy start for every project.

## Using this template

Starting a new project:

```
forge init --template https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-template my_project_name
cd my_project_name
```

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```
forge install
```

Build the project:

```
forge build
```

Run the tests:

```
forge test
```

Install specific dependencies:

forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts

forge install transmissions11/solmate

forge install solidstate-network/solidstate-solidity

forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable

forge install chiru-labs/ERC721A
